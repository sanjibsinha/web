Installing basic software should be the very first step with which we should start with web development. So, letâ€™s start with the web.

Next we will install a few basic software. That step is simple enough to go ahead. So donâ€™t get scared.

Why do we need them in the first place?

For example we need a few tools you need to do simple web development and show you how to install them properly.

The first question is â€“ what tools do I actually need, right now?

Donâ€™t worry, we will need the minimum most. In fact, weâ€™ll set you up with the bare minimum â€” a text editor and some modern web browsers.

Installing a text editor is as easy as giving promises to your spouse before marriage because you both know that an extra marital affair is in the offing very soon. ðŸ˜‚

A text editor always comes with an OS. Think about Windows; it includes Notepad and macOS comes with TextEdit. Linux distros vary; the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS release comes with GNOME Text Editor by default. 

But we need a good IDE like Visual Studio Code, which is a free editor that offers live previews and code hints. 

And if you have GitHub Copilot, it will do the 80 percent staff on your behalf. But alas, itâ€™s not free.

If your parents have black money go ahead for the Copilot. ðŸ˜£

You donâ€™t have to Install modern web browsers. Because every OS comes with its own.

By default, Ubuntu comes with Mozilla Firefox. And on top of that you can install Google Chrome.

However, I will also recommend installing ChatGPT. It will help you a lot to generate code.  

Since ChatGPT runs on AI, donâ€™t trust its code. Always run them in your code editor and check whether it has a full erection or not.

Otherwise your partner will suffer a lot for your poor erectile dysfunction and you will also suffer from an penile-size-anxiety-disorder.

In the next section we will talk more about browser, web server and many secret things that you cannot imagine.

So stay tuned and hold yourself. You can do it without any medical interference.
